### **Homework Assignment: Functions in Python**

---

#### **Objective**:

To test your understanding of functions, including creating, using, and interacting with them. You will also apply concepts like parameters, return values, recursion, and decomposition.

---

### **Part 1: Basic Functions**

1. **Hello Function**Write a function `say_hello()` that prints `"Hello, Python!"`.

   **Output Example**:

   ```
   Hello, Python!
   ```
2. **Square a Number**Write a function `square(number)` that takes a number and returns its square.

   **Example**:

   ```python
   square(5)  # Output: 25
   ```
3. **Area of a Rectangle**
   Write a function `calculate_area(length, width)` that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle.

   **Example**:

   ```python
   calculate_area(5, 3)  # Output: 15
   ```

### **Part 2: Intermediate Functions**

4. **Temperature Converter**Write a function `convert_temperature(value, to_unit)` that converts a temperature value between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Include default parameters to set `to_unit="C"`.

   **Example**:

   ```python
   convert_temperature(100, "F")  # Output: 212.0
   convert_temperature(32)       # Output: 0.0
   ```
5. **Recursive Factorial**Write a recursive function `factorial_recursive(n)` that calculates the factorial of a number.

   **Example**:

   ```python
   factorial_recursive(5)  # Output: 120
   ```
6. **Maximum of Three**
   Create a function `find_max(a, b, c)` that returns the largest of three numbers.

   **Example**:

   ```python
   find_max(3, 7, 5)  # Output: 7
   ```

#### **Instructions**:

1. Write your solutions in a `.py` file or notebook.
2. Test each function with at least two different sets of inputs.
3. Submit your file or screenshots of your results.
