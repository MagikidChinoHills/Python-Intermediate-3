## Problem 1: Count the Odd Numbers
Write a function called count_odds that takes a list of integers and returns how many of the numbers are odd.

Example:

count_odds([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Output: 3


## Problem 2: Multiply All Elements
Write a function called product_total that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all the elements.

Example:

product_total([1, 2, 3, 4])  # Output: 24


## Problem 3: Reverse a List (Without Using Built-in Functions)
Write a function called reverse_list that takes a list and returns a new list that is the reverse of the original, using a loop.

Example:

reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4])  # Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]


## Problem 4: Common Elements in Two Lists
Write a function called find_common_elements that takes two lists and returns a new list containing only the elements found in both.

Example:

find_common_elements([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])  # Output: [2, 3]


## Problem 5: Copy List by Value
Write a function called copy_list_by_value that takes a list and returns a new list that is a copy (not a reference), then modifies one element in the new list and prints both lists to show they are different.

Example:

copy_list_by_value([10, 20, 30])

Should print:

Original list: [10, 20, 30]

New list: [10, 20, 99]
