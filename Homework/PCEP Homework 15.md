### **Homework 15: Iterating with List Slicing**

#### **Instructions:**

For each problem, write the expected output before running the code. Use list slicing and loops to solve each problem.

### **1. Extract and Print Every Second Element**

#### **Task:** Given a list of numbers, extract every second element and print it.

```
numbers = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
# Write your slicing operation here
```

âœ… **Expected Output:** (Write your prediction here)

---

### **2. Extract a Subset of a List**

#### **Task:** Extract and print the first five elements of a list using slicing.

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry", "fig", "grape", "honeydew"]
# Write your slicing operation here
```

âœ… **Expected Output:** (Write your prediction here)

---

### **3. Reverse and Print a List**

#### **Task:** Reverse a list using slicing and print it.

```
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Emma"]
# Write your slicing operation here
```

âœ… **Expected Output:** (Write your prediction here)

---

### **4. Sum of Every Third Number**

#### **Task:** Calculate the sum of every third number in a list.

```
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24]
# Write your slicing and summing logic here
```

âœ… **Expected Output:** (Write your prediction here)

---

### **5. Check if a Word is a Palindrome**

#### **Task:** Use slicing to check if a word reads the same forward and backward.

```
word = "madam"
# Write your palindrome check here
```

âœ… **Expected Output:** (Write your prediction here)

---

### **Challenge:**

Create a function that takes a list and a step value, and prints every `step`th element of the list.

```
def custom_step_slicing(lst, step):
    # Implement your slicing logic here

# Test your function with different step values
```

âœ… **Try it with different lists and step values!**

---

ðŸ”Ž **Tip:** Before running the code, **predict the output** based on what youâ€™ve learned about slicing. Test your solutions and compare results!
