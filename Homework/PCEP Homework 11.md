# **Lesson 11: Advanced Loops in Python - Homework**

## **Instructions:**

Complete the following exercises using your understanding of  **for loops, while loops, built-in functions, and nested loops** . Provide explanations for each answer.

---

### **1. Understanding Loop Execution**

Describe the difference between a **for loop** and a  **while loop** . Provide an example scenario where each would be the better choice.

---

### **2. Using `enumerate()`**

Explain the purpose of `enumerate()`. Given a list of cities:

Cities: `['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Miami']`

* How would `enumerate()` be useful when looping through this list?
* What is the output when `enumerate()` is used?

---

### **3. Nested Loops Application**

Consider a  **3x3 matrix** :

```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
```

* Explain how a nested loop can be used to  **print each element in row-major order** .
* If you only wanted to print the  **diagonal elements** , how would your approach change?

---

### **4. List Comprehension Challenge**

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Given the list:

Numbers: `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]`

* Use list comprehension to extract all numbers  **divisible by 5 but not by 10** .
* Why is this approach more efficient than a standard loop?

---

### **5. Loop Control Statements**

Explain the role of `break` and `continue` statements in loops. Given a loop that processes a list of numbers:

Numbers: `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]`

* Modify the loop so that it  **stops processing if it encounters 20** .
* Modify the loop so that it  **skips processing 15 but continues for the rest** .
