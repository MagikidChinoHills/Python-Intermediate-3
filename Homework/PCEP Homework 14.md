# Homework 14: Operator Precedence

### Instructions:

For each problem, analyze the given Python expression and determine the output before running the code. Write down your thought process step-by-step to explain how you arrived at your answer.

Problem 1: Order of Operations


```python
print(10 + 3 * 2)
```

**Question:** What will be printed? Explain the order in which the operations are executed.

Problem 2: Parentheses Usage


```python
print((10 + 3) * 2)
```

**Question:** How does adding parentheses change the result compared to Problem 1?

**Problem 3:** Exponentiation and Division


```python
print(4 ** 2 / 8)
```

**Question:** Which operation happens first, exponentiation or division? What is the final output?

**Problem 4:** Modulus and Floor Division


```python
print(15 // 4 % 3)
```

**Question:** In what order are the `//` (floor division) and `%` (modulus) operators evaluated? What will the result be?

**Problem 5:** Mixed Operators and Unary Minus


```python
print(-2 ** 3 + 5 * 2)
```

**Question:** How does the unary minus interact with exponentiation? What will be the final result?

Bonus Challenge:

Write your own expression using at least **four different operators** and test your prediction before running it in Python. Explain how Python evaluates your expression.


```python
